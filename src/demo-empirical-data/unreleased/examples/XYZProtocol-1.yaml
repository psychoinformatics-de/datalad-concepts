description: 'At the time of capture, each adult penguin was quickly blood sampled
  (~1 ml) from the brachial vein using a sterile 3 ml syringe and heparinized infusion
  needle.

  Collected blood was stored in 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes that were kept cool.

  In the field, a small amount of whole blood was smeared on clean filter paper stored
  in a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube for molecular sexing.'
