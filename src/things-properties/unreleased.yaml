title: Collection of common properties for use with the things schema
description: |
  This schema provides a collection of common data properties and object
  properties for use with the things schema.
  It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or any of its
  individual property definitions can be used by their URI as vocabulary
  components or definitions (e.g., `dlthings:name` identified by this
  [URI](`name`)).

  Slot names use the plural form whenever they are directly declared as
  "multivalued" in this schema, otherwise the singular form is used for
  the slot name. The `slot_uri` always uses the singular form.

  Every property declared here is mapped to at least one standard/established
  vocabulary.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
