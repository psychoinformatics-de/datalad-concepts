title: Data models for an organization's research assets
description: |
  This schema is using the FLAT approach (Flexbile Low-complexity
  Annotation Technique) and is geared toward metadata entry and
  submission for pooling information across consortium sites and
  partners.

  It is to be taken as a demonstrator rather than a schema
  building block.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)
