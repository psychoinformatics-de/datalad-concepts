title: Concepts for hierarchical data representations for use with the things schema
description: |
  The schema defines conceptual models for datasets and individual data items
  to describe their nature and relationships across formats and linked with
  their serializationa (see `things-distribution` and `things-files`)

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

classes:
  DataItem:
    is_a: ValueSpecification
    description: >-
      An information content entity that is intended to be a truthful statement
      about something (modulo, e.g., measurement precision or other systematic
      errors) and is constructed/acquired by a method which reliably tends to
      produce (approximately) truthful statements.

      This is a conceptual entity. A single data item might be available in
      more than one representation, with differing formats, and serializations.
    slots:
      - part_of
    slot_usage:
      part_of:
        range: Dataset
        multivalued: true
    exact_mappings:
      - obo:IAO_0000027

  Dataset:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A collection of data (data items), published or curated by a single
      agent.  This is a conceptual entity. A single dataset might be available
      in more than one representation, with differing schematic layouts,
      formats, and serializations.
