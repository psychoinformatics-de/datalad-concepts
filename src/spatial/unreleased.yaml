    description: >-
      A location can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112), but it
      can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory, row, or column.
      As such, there are numerous ways in which location can be expressed, such
      as by a coordinate, address, landmark, and so forth.

      - identifiers
