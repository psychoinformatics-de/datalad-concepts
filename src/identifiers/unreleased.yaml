title: Schema components to express identifiers of things
description: |
  This schema implements some aspects of the [identifier
  concept](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/#dt_identifier) of the [Asset
  Description Metadata Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/#dt_identifier)
  (ADMS). The provided [`identifiers` slot](identifiers) can be used to annotate
  entities with identifiers with arbitrary scopes and issued by arbitrary agencies.

  The schema also covered "content identifier" that are directly derived from
  an entity ([`ComputedIdentifier`](ComputedIdentifier)), and a
  [`Checksum`](Checksum) in particular.

  This schema also incorporates the schema(s)

  - [`types`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/types/unreleased)

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

    notes:
      - The `range` is only `uriorcurie` here (and not `Thing`), because
        we have an `ifabsent` declaration for DOIs that only work with this
        type. And even for that it needs a patch.

      An identifier is a label that uniquely identifies an item in a
      particular context. Some identifiers are globally unique. All
      identifiers are unique within their individual scope.

    description: >-
      A Checksum is a value that allows to check the integrity of the contents
      of a file. Even small changes to the content of the file will change its
      checksum. This class allows the results of a variety of checksum and
      cryptographic message digest algorithms to be represented.
