  AccessMethod:
    class_uri: dlres:AccessMethod
    description: >-
      An approach or procedure to gain access to the subject.
    comments:
      - This is merely a base class for range declaration. It does not define any slots other than a type designator, because little or no commonalities of properties across access methods are to be expected.
    slots:
      - schema_type

  Dataset:
    class_uri: dlres:Dataset
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent. This is a
      conceptual entity. A single dataset might be available in more than
      one representation, with differing schematic layouts, formats, and serializations.
    disjoint_with:
      - Document
      - Grant
      - Instrument
    exact_mappings:
      - dcat:Dataset
    slots:
      - distributions

  Distribution:
    class_uri: dlres:Distribution
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A specific representation of a resource, which may come in the form of
      a physical object, or an electronic file, or an archive or directory
      of many files, may be standalone or part of a larger collection.
    notes:
      - A `Distribution` is derived from `Resource`, following the logic
        that it is a materialized/specialized variant of a particular
        resource. It therefore should inherit all its slots. This is
        in contrast to DCAT, where `Distribution` is not a subclass.
        However, in DCAT a `Distribution` also does not have a version.
        Here we do want that, for example, to express an update
        of a format conversion, where no data change, only the layout.

  Document:
    class_uri: dlres:Document
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A conceptual entity representing things which a, broadly conceived,
      "documents. This includes non-textual things like images.
      A conceputal document is to be distinguished from its physical,
      or electronic distributions.
    slots:
      - distributions
    disjoint_with:
      - Dataset
      - Grant
      - Instrument
    notes:
      - The key difference between a dataset and a document is the collection-nature of the dataset (multiple items of a kind in a collection), whereas a document is "one of its kind". A dataset could comprise multiple documents.
    exact_mappings:
      - foaf:Document

  Grant:
    class_uri: dlres:Grant
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, resources.
    slots:
      - sponsor
    disjoint_with:
      - Dataset
      - Document
      - Instrument
    notes:
      - A grant is not a document. The associated document would be the
        grant agreement.

      - schema:Grant

  IndexedResourceRelationship:
    is_a: Relationship
    description: >-
      An association class for attaching a `locator` as additional information to a
      `hasPart` relationship.
    slots:
      - locator
    slot_usage:
      locator:
        key: true
      object:
        required: true
        range: Resource

  IndexedResourcePart:
    is_a: IndexedResourceRelationship
    description: >-
      An association class for attaching an index `locator` as additional information to a
      `hasPart` relationship.

  IndexedResourcePartOf:
    is_a: IndexedResourceRelationship
    description: >-
      An association class for attaching an index `locator` as additional information to a
      `isPartOf` relationship.

  Instrument:
    class_uri: dlres:Instrument
    is_a: Resource
    description: >-
      A thing that enables an agent to perform an action. This is typically a device
      (e.g., a machine to perform a particular type of measurement), but it can also be
      a questionnaire that is used to perform a particular kind of assessment.
      An instrument is typically not a "reagent".

  PersonalRequest:

      The act of personally making a request to get access to the subject
      by following some described procedure.
