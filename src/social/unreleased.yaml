title: Schema for a generic (data) provenance annotation
description: |
  This schema builds on the [PROV schema](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/prov),
  and diversifies its [`Agent`](Agent) concept to cover aspects of social
  relations and concepts.

  With [`Person`](Person), and [`Organization`](Organization), two
  essential [`Agent`](Agent) types included in `PROV` are provided here.

  A custom CURIE prefix `email:` is defined and emitted to allow for using
  emails as suitable schema identifiers for an email address (e.g.,
  `email:me@example.org`).

  This schema also incorporates the schemas

  - [`properties`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/properties/unreleased)
  - [`prov`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/prov/unreleased)

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

    comments:
      - This class does not offer common slots like "affiliation" or "email".
        Instead, this information should be expressed as `qualified_relations`
        to other things with a role characterization. An affiliation can be
        expressed as a relation to an organization, and the role that the
        organization has for the person (e.g., "employer").
        This approach has the advantage that relations like a membership can be
        expressed at either end (at an organizations potential `members` slot,
        but also (symmetrically) as a persons potential `member_of` slot).

      - This class does not offer common slots like "address" or "contact".
        Instead, this information should be expressed as `qualified_relations`
        to other things with a role-characterization. An address can be
        expressed as a relation to a location, and the role this location
        has for the organization (e.g., "main office"). Likewise, a contact
        can be describe as a relation to a person, and the role that this
        person fulfills for the organization (e.g., "spokesperson").

  Project:
