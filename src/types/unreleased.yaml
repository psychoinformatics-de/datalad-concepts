title: Collection of common types for use in schemas
description: |
  This schema provides a collection of common types for use in other
  schemas. It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or
  any of its individual property definitions can be used by their
  URI as vocabulary components or definitions (e.g., `dltypes:type`
  identified by this [URI](`type`)).

  Class definitions are only included insofar as they define ranges
  for particular property slots.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

types:
  HexBinary:
    uri: xsd:hexBinary
    base: str
    pattern: "^[a-fA-F0-9]+$"
    description: >-
      hex-encoded binary data.

  NodeUriOrCurie:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      A type referencing an graph node. This is like `uriorcurie`, but in
      an RDF export leads to the desirable `rdf.type` declaration, rather
      then an `rdf.literal` of the corresponding URI.
    base: str
    uri: rdfs:Resource

slots:
  type:
    slot_uri: rdf:type
    designates_type: true
    description: >-
      State that the subject is an instance of a particular RDF class.
      Typically, no explicit value needs to be assigned to this slot,
      because it matches the class type of a particular record.
      However, this slots can be used as a type designator of a schema
      element for validation and schema structure handling purposes.
      This is used to indicate specialized schema classes for properties
      that accept a hierarchy of classes as their range.
