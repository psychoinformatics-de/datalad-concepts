title: Concepts related to resources for use with the things schema
description: |
  *This is an unreleased development version*

  Resources here are things that enable, inform, or are otherwise utilizes
  by activities. This schema provides a number of classes for select
  concept in this domain, such as `Convention`, `Document`, and
  `Instrument`.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../v1.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../v1.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../v1.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../v1.owl.ttl)

classes:
  Convention:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards, norms,
      social norms, or criteria, often taking the form of a custom.

  Document:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A conceptual entity representing things which a, broadly conceived,
      "documents. This includes non-textual things like images.
      A conceputal document is to be distinguished from its physical,
      or electronic distributions.
    slots:
      - title
      - part_of
    slot_usage:
      part_of:
        range: Document
        multivalued: true
    notes:
      - The key difference between a dataset and a document is the
        collection-nature of the dataset (multiple items of a kind in
        a collection), whereas a document is "one of its kind". A
        dataset could comprise multiple documents.
      - A document typically has at least one author. However, there are
        also generated documents (e.g., a birth certificate) for which this is
        irrelevant. And there are more roles that could be relevant for a
        document's provenance. Rather than adding them all, none is provided.
        PROV should be used to express this information.
    exact_mappings:
      - foaf:Document

  Grant:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable,
      resources.
    slots:
      - title
      - short_name
      - part_of
    slot_usage:
      part_of:
        range: Grant
        multivalued: true
    exact_mappings:
      - obo:NCIT_C16644
      - schema:Grant
    notes:
      - A grant is not a document. The associated document would be the
        grant agreement.

  Instrument:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A thing that enables an agent to perform an action. This is typically a device
      (e.g., a machine to perform a particular type of measurement), but it can also be
      a questionnaire that is used to perform a particular kind of assessment.
      An instrument is typically not a "reagent".
    related_mappings:
      - schema:instrument
    narrow_mappings:
      - obo:NCIT_C62103
    notes:
      - It is unclear whether an instrument `name` would provide meaningful
        and precise information (vs a description or an identifier).
        There is `display_label`, if the need for a name is just for display
        purposes (e.g., to say something generic like 'thermometer').
      - Slot `name` is added to avoid `display_label` having to carry unique
        information.
    slots:
      - name
