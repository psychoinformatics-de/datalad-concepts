title: Collection of common properties for use in schemas
description: |
  This schema provides a collection of common properties for use in other
  schemas. It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or
  any of its individual property definitions can be used by their
  URI as vocabulary components or definitions (e.g., `dlprops:name`
  identified by this [URI](`name`)).

  Class definitions are only included insofar as they define ranges
  for particular property slots.

  Slot names use the plural form whenever they are directly declared as
  "multivalued" in this schema, otherwise the singular form is used for
  the slot name. The `slot_uri` always uses the singular form.

  Every property declared here is mapped to standard/established vocabularies.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

      An established standard to which the subject conforms.

      - This property SHOULD be used to indicate a model, schema, ontology, view or profile that the subject conforms to.

    description: A free-text account of the subject.

  about:
    slot_uri: dlprops:about
    description: >-
      A relation of an information artifact to the subject, such as
      a URL identifying the topic of a document.
    range: uriorcurie

  name:
    slot_uri: dlprops:name
    description: >-
      Name of the subject. A name is closely related to a `title`, but often
      more compact and identifier-like, but without the implication of
      uniqueness of an identifier. A name is often used by technical systems
      to display an item in an organizational structure, such as a file
      in a directory hierarchy.

      - rdfs:label
      - schema:name

    close_mappings:
      - dlprops:title
    range: string

  same_as:
    slot_uri: dlprops:same_as
    description: >-
      Declares that the subject and an object are equal.
      Can be used to indicate a URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously
      indicates the subject's identity. For example, the URL of the subject's
      Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
    range: uriorcurie
    exact_mappings:
      - owl:sameAs
    close_mappings:

  short_name:
    slot_uri: dlprops:short_name
    is_a: name
    description: >-
      A shortened name for the subject. For example, an acronym, initialism,
      nickname, or other abbreviation of the `name`.
    exact_mappings:
      - pq:P1813
    range: string

  title:
    slot_uri: dlprops:title
    description: >-
      A summarily description of the subject. It is closely related to
      a `name`, but often less compact and more descriptive. Typically used for
      documents.
