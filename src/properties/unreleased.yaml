title: Collection of common properties for use in schemas
description: |
  This schema provides a collection of common properties for use in other
  schemas. It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or
  any of its individual property definitions can be used by their
  URI as vocabulary components or definitions (e.g., `dlprops:name`
  identified by this [URI](`name`)).

  Class definitions are only included insofar as they define ranges
  for particular property slots.

  Slot names use the plural form whenever they are directly declared as
  "multivalued" in this schema, otherwise the singular form is used for
  the slot name. The `slot_uri` always uses the singular form.

  Every property declared here is mapped to standard/established vocabularies.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)
