slots:
  at_time:
    slot_uri: dltemporal:at_time
    description: >-
      Time at which an instanteneous event takes place or took place.

    notes:
      - successful validation with `datetime` as a range and linkml-jsonschema-validate` depends on a patched linkml, see https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues/1806
      - a related problem also exists for `linkml-validate`, we cannot have a more specific range right now
