title: Collection of provenance properties for use in schemas
description: |
  This schema mixin provides a collection of provenance properties for use in other
  schemas. It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or any of its
  individual property definitions can be used by their URI as vocabulary
  components or definitions (e.g., `prov-mixin:name` identified by this
  [URI](`name`)).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

slots:
  alternate_of:
    description: >-
      Two alternate entities present aspects of the same thing. These aspects
      may be the same or different, and the alternate entities may or may not
      overlap in time.
    range: Thing
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:alternateOf

  associated_with:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent
      for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.
      It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended
      by the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasAssociatedWith" is a short-cut property. "Association" also has "agent".
    exact_mappings:
      -  prov:wasAssociatedWith

  attributed_to:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      Attribution is the ascribing of an entity to an agent.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasAttributedTo" is a short-cut property. "Attribution" also has "agent".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasAttributedTo

  delegated_by:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an
      agent (by itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity
      as a delegate or representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of
      retains some responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work.
      For example, a student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted
      on behalf of the department chair, who acted on behalf of the university;
      all those agents are responsible in some way for the activity that took
      place but we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what
      degree.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - This is PROV-O's "acted_on_behalf_of", which is a short-cut property -- "Delegation" also identifies an agent.
      - naming is different for homogeneity with the other slots
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:actedOnBehalfOf

  derived_from:
    is_a: influenced_by
    title: Derived from
    description: >-
      A entity from which the subject was created through some kind of process.
      Derivation is a transformation of an entity into another,
      an update of an entity resulting in a new one, or the
      construction of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasDerivedFrom" is a short-cut property. "Derivation" also has "entity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasDerivedFrom

  ended:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      End is when an activity is deemed to have been ended by an entity, known
      as trigger. The activity no longer exists after its end. Any usage,
      generation, or invalidation involving an activity precedes the activity's
      end. An end may refer to a trigger entity that terminated the activity,
      or to an activity, known as ender that generated the trigger.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "endedAt" is a short-cut property. "Start" also has "atTime".
      - same naming remarks as for "started" apply.
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasEndedBy

  generated_by:
    is_a: influenced_by
    title: Generated by
    description: >-
      Identification of the process that led to the production of the subject entity.
      Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an activity.
      This entity did not exist before generation and becomes available for usage
      after this generation.
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasGeneratedBy" is a short-cut property. "Generation" also has "activity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasGeneratedBy
    range: Thing

  influenced_by:
    title: Influenced by
    description: >-
      Influence is the capacity of an entity, activity, or agent to have an
      effect on the character, development, or behavior of another by means
      of usage, start, end, generation, invalidation, communication,
      derivation, attribution, association, or delegation.
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasInfluencedBy" is a short-cut property. "Influence" also identifies an "influencer".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasInfluencedBy
    range: Thing

  informed_by:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      Communication is the exchange of an entity by two activities, one
      activity using the entity generated by the other.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasInformedBy" is a short-cut property. "Communication" also has "activity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasInformedBy

  invalidated_by:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      Invalidation is the start of the destruction, cessation, or expiry of
      an existing entity by an activity. The entity is no longer available
      for use (or further invalidation) after invalidation. Any generation
      or usage of an entity precedes its invalidation.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasInvalidatedBy" is a short-cut property. "Invalidation" also identifies an "entity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasInvalidatedBy

  quoted_from:
    is_a: derived_from
    description: >-
      A quotation is the repeat of (some or all of) an entity, such as
      text or image, by someone who may or may not be its original author.
      Quotation is a particular case of derivation.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasQuotedFrom" is a short-cut property. "Quotation" also identifies an "entity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasQuotedFrom

  revision_of:
    is_a: derived_from
    description: >-
      A revision is a derivation for which the resulting entity is a revised
      version of some original. The implication here is that the resulting
      entity contains substantial content from the original. Revision is a
      particular case of derivation.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "wasRevisionOf" is a short-cut property. "Revision" also identifies an "entity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasRevisionOf

  specialization_of:
    is_a: alternate_of
    description: >-
      An entity that is a specialization of another shares all aspects of
      the latter, and additionally presents more specific aspects of the
      same thing as the latter. In particular, the lifetime of the entity
      being specialized contains that of any specialization. Examples of
      aspects include a time period, an abstraction, and a context associated
      with the entity.
    range: Thing
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:specializationOf

  started:
    is_a: influenced_by
    description: >-
      Start is when an activity is deemed to have been started by an entity,
      known as trigger. The activity did not exist before its start. Any
      usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity follows the
      activity's start. A start may refer to a trigger entity that set off
      the activity, or to an activity, known as starter, that generated
      the trigger.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "startedAt" is a short-cut property. "Start" also has "atTime".
      - name is just started, because the association class Start has both time information and trigger information. Hence the name needs to capture both started_by and started_at. "started" has the unfortunate ambiguity of having started an activity, however the range "Start" is an "EntityInfluence" where the linked "object" is an Entity -- hopefully limiting the confusion.
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:wasStartedBy

  used:
    title: Used
    description: >-
      Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity.
      Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity and
      could not have been affected by the entity.
    range: Thing
    notes:
      - PROV-O "used" is a short-cut property. "Usage" also has "entity".
    exact_mappings:
      - prov:used
