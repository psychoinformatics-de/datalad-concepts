      During the workshop, it became clear to me that the consensus based
      models (which are often graphical in nature) can not only be formalized
      but also be directly connected to these database focused formalizations.
      I just needed to get over the differences in syntax.  This could imply
      that we could have nice way to trace provenance across systems and
      through databases and be able to understand the mathematical properties
      of this interconnection.
