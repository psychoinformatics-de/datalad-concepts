title: Schema for a generic (data) provenance annotation
description: |
  This schema builds on the [Thing
  schema](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/thing), and diversifies it to capture
  the key provenance concepts [`Agent`](Agent), [`Activity`](Activity),
  [`Entity`](Entity), and their relationships.  It does that by drawing on (a
  subset) of the PROV data model [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm).

  Central paradigm of the schema is the [qualified relation
  pattern](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html).
  The three [`Thing`](Thing) derived key concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, and
  `Entity` build on the `Thing` slot `relations` (symmetric property) for
  **inline declaration** of related things, and extend the basic means of
  qualifying a relationship via [`is_characterized_by`](is_characterized_by)
  and with provenance specific slots, and
  [`qualified_relations`](qualified_relations) for declaring the roles of
  related things.
 
  Specifically the latter approach takes the place of all of the various
  `qualified*` properties defined in `PROV`. Rather than supporting association
  classes like `prov:Derivation` or `prov:Generation`, such relationships are
  annotated by linking to things via slots like
  [`was_derived_from`](was_derived_from) or
  [`was_generated_by`](was_generated_by), and characterizing the relationship
  via [`qualified_relations`](qualified_relations), and a (custom)
  [`Role`](Role) declaration.
 
  The schema is entity-centric, meaning that entity properties are preferred
  over activity properties expressing the same (inverse) relationship. For
  example, an entity's [`was_generated_by`](was_generated_by) is implemented,
  but not an activity's `generated`.

  With [`Person`](Person), [`Organization`](Organization), and
  [`SoftwareAgent`](SoftwareAgent), the three essential [`Agent`](Agent) types
  included in `PROV` are supported. However, these classes provide no
  additional slots over their base class. Their purpose is only semantic
  differentiation.

  A custom CURIE prefix `email:` is defined and emitted to allow for using
  emails as suitable schema identifiers for an email address (e.g.,
  `email:me@example.com`).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

      An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent
      for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.
      It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended
      by the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.

      Something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity

        This class does not support even a basic `name` slot, because
        depending on the context, there may not be a suitable name,
        or one name would not be enough. If no specialized derived
        class is available in a context where a `name` or similar
        attribute is desired, it can be expressed via the
        `has_attributes` slot.


  Activity:
    class_uri: dlprov:Activity
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts
      upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing,
      transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.
    slots:
      - at_location

      - This class does not offer common slots like "affiliation" or "email".
        Instead, this information should be expressed as `qualified_relations`
        to other things with a role characterization. An affiliation can be
        expressed as a relation to an organization, and the role that the
        organization has for the person (e.g., "employer").

  Organization:
    class_uri: dlprov:Organization
    is_a: Agent
    description: >-
      A social or legal instititution such as a company, a society,
      or a university.

      - This class does not offer common slots like "address" or "contact".
        Instead, this information should be expressed as `qualified_relations`
        to other things with a role-characterization. An address can be
        expressed as a relation to a location, and the role this location
        has for the organization (e.g., "main office"). Likewise, a contact
        can be describe as a relation to a person, and the role that this
        person fulfills for the organization (e.g., "spokesperson").
