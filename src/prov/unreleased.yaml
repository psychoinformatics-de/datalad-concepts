title: Schema for a generic (data) provenance annotation
description: |
  This schema builds on the [Thing
  schema](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/things), and diversifies it to capture
  the key provenance concepts [`Agent`](Agent), [`Activity`](Activity),
  [`Entity`](Entity), and their relationships.  It does that by drawing on (a
  subset) of the PROV data model [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm).

  Central paradigm of the schema is the [qualified relation
  pattern](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html).
  The three [`Thing`](Thing) derived key concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, and
  `Entity` build on the `Thing` slot `relations` (symmetric property) for
  **inline declaration** of related things, and extend the basic means of
  qualifying a relationship via [`characterized_by`](characterized_by)
  and with provenance specific slots, and
  [`qualified_relations`](qualified_relations) for declaring the roles of
  related things.
 
  Specifically the latter approach takes the place of all of the various
  `qualified*` properties defined in `PROV`. Rather than supporting association
  classes like `prov:Derivation` or `prov:Generation`, such relationships are
  annotated by linking to things via slots like
  [`derived_from`](derived_from) or
  [`generated_by`](generated_by), and characterizing the relationship
  via [`qualified_relations`](qualified_relations), and a (custom)
  [`Role`](Role) declaration.
 
  The schema is entity-centric, meaning that entity properties are preferred
  over activity properties expressing the same (inverse) relationship. For
  example, an entity's [`generated_by`](generated_by) is implemented,
  but not an activity's `generated`.

  This schema also incorporates the schemas

  - [`identifiers`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/identifiers/unreleased)
  - [`things`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/things/v1)
  - [`roles`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/roles/unreleased)
  - [`spatial`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/spatial/unreleased)
  - [`temporal`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/temporal/unreleased)

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

      An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an agent
      for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.
      It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended
      by the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.

        This class does not support even a basic `name` slot, because
        depending on the context, there may not be a suitable name,
        or one name would not be enough. If no specialized derived
        class is available in a context where a `name` or similar
        attribute is desired, it can be expressed via the
        `has_attributes` slot.


  Activity:
    class_uri: dlprov:Activity
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts
      upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing,
      transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.
