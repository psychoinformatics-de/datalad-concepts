title: Concepts related to rules applying to resources for use with the things schema
description: |
  Rules can be restricting or granting permissions. A concrete example
  is a license. However, a rule can also be a requirement that has to be met
  in order to be able to use a resource, such as a citation or acknowledgment
  requirement.

  This schema provides a `rules` slot, and an associated `Rule` class that
  can be used to capture permissions and regulation for a wide range of
  concepts.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../v1.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../v1.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../v1.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../v1.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../v1.shacl.ttl)

  Upcoming changes to this schema may be available in an [(unreleased)
  development version](../../things-rules/unreleased).
