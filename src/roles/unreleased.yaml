title: Schema for characterizing relationships with roles
description: |
  This schema provides the most basic classes and slots to qualify
  relationships between two things. The connection to the
  [thing-schema](../../thing) is the [`qualified_relations`](qualified_relations)
  slot, which can be used to qualify relations between things via any number
  of [`Relationship`](Relationship) declarations.

  Each `Relationship` links one object (`Thing`) to a subject (`Thing`) and
  associates one or more roles ([`Role`](Role)) with this relationship via the
  [`roles`](roles) slot.

  A `Role` is itself a `Thing`, and can be annotated with (inline)
  attributes as needed. However, typically it should be sufficient
  to reference a role by a URI.

  This schema also incorporates the schemas

  - [`things`](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/things/v1)

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

  Relationship:
    class_uri: dlroles:Relationship
    description: >-
      An association class for characterizing the relation between two things with
      the role(s) the object had with respect to the subject. A relationship is
      always between two things only, but can be annotated with multiple roles
      (for example, a person having both an author role with respect to a dataset,
      and also being the person who is legally responsible contact for it).
