title: Data model for capturing information on research (progress)
description: |
  This schema is using the FLAT approach (Flexbile Low-complexity
  Annotation Technique) and is geared toward metadata entry and
  submission for pooling information across consortium sites and
  partners.

  It is to be taken as a demonstrator rather than a schema
  building block.

  Key features of this schema:

  - adds a PROV interface to a select set of concepts where provenance
    information shall be recorded. Not all classes receive a PROV interface,
    because some are just used as classifiers or tags. This limits the
    expressiveness of the schema, but also its complexity. For example,
    it is an active decision to *not* be interested in the provenance
    of a `Convention` or a `Rule`, but to only represent them as facts
    about the world.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

      A thing that enables an agent to perform an action. This is typically a
      device (e.g., a machine to perform a particular type of measurement), but
      it can also be a questionnaire that is used to perform a particular kind
      of assessment.

      An instrument is typically neither a "reagent", nor an abstract concept.
      For example, in the case of behavioral experiment with a particular
      stimulus, only the concrete implementation of the stimulation would be
      considered an `Instrument`, while the underlying abstract paradigm would
      be captured as a `Concept`. In the case of a personality test, the
      `Instrument` is a concrete questionnaire implementation, whereas an
      underlying personality model factor is to be considered as a `Concept`.

      The primary purpose of this metadata type is the identification of
      instruments used in (data) generating activities.

    is_a: Thing
    title: Concept
    description: >-
      An idea or notion; a unit of thought.

      In the context of a study, this can be a tag associated with a
      categorical, independent variable in a study design, an
      investigative role (e.g., treatments), or an organizational
      nature (e.g., site labels), or a dependent or outcome variable.

      `Concept` is related to `Topic`. However a concept is more focused
      and more clearly delineated in comparison.

      The primary purpose of this metadata type is the identification of
      influencing factors or outcome variable related to (scientific)
      investigations.
    comments:
      - The relationship of a focused concept with the broader concept
        can be described via `broader_mappings`.

  XYZAgentInfluence:

    # purposed. it shows up as an alternative wherever XYZInfluence is the

    # the space for possible object and roles instances. other than that
    # it does not change the semantics or structure compared to XYZInfluence,
