title: Data model for capturing information on research (progress)
description: |
  This schema is using the FLAT approach (Flexbile Low-complexity
  Annotation Technique) and is geared toward metadata entry and
  submission for pooling information across consortium sites and
  partners.

  It is to be taken as a demonstrator rather than a schema
  building block.

  Key features of this schema:

  - adds a PROV interface to a select set of concepts where provenance
    information shall be recorded. Not all classes receive a PROV interface,
    because some are just used as classifiers or tags. This limits the
    expressiveness of the schema, but also its complexity. For example,
    it is an active decision to *not* be interested in the provenance
    of a `Convention` or a `Rule`, but to only represent them as facts
    about the world.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

  XYZAgentInfluence:
    # this is not derived from AgentInfluence, because we only need it for UI
    # purposed. it shows up as an alternative wherever XYZInfluence is the
    # range (e.g. influenced_by). it provides an effective way to constrain
    # the space for possible object and roles instances. other than that
    # it does not change the semantics or structure compared to XYZInfluence,
    # hence any instance continues to be fully compatible with no loss of
    # information when "seen" through the interface of XYZInfluence

  XYZAttribution:
    is_a: Attribution
    description: >-
      Attribution is the ascribing of an entity to an agent. When an entity
      e is attributed to agent ag, entity e was generated by some unspecified
      activity that in turn was associated to agent ag. Thus, this relation
      is useful when the activity is not known, or irrelevant.

  XYZCommunication:
    is_a: Communication
    title: Communication
    description: >-
      The exchange of an entity by two activities, one activity using the entity
      generated by the other. This implies a dependency of the subject
      activity on the associated activity.

  XYZDelegation:
    is_a: Delegation
    title: Delegation
    description: >-
      Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an
      agent (by itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity
      as a delegate or representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of
      retains some responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work.
      For example, a student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on
      behalf of the department chair, who acted on behalf of the university;
      all those agents are responsible in some way for the activity that took
      place but we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what
      degree.

  XYZDerivation:
    is_a: Derivation
    description: >-
      A derivation is a transformation of an entity into another, an

      of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity.

  XYZEnd:
    is_a: End
    description: >-
      End is when an activity is deemed to have been ended by an entity,
      known as trigger. The activity no longer exists after its end. Any
      usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity precedes
      the activity's end. An end may refer to a trigger entity that
      terminated the activity, or to an activity, known as ender that
      generated the trigger.

  XYZGeneration:
    is_a: Generation
    description: >-
      Generation is the completion of production of a new entity by an
      activity. This entity did not exist before generation and becomes
      available for usage after this generation.

  XYZInfluence:
    is_a: Influence
    description: >-
      Influence is the capacity of an entity, activity, or agent to have
      an effect on the character, development, or behavior of another by
      means of usage, start, end, generation, invalidation, communication,
      derivation, attribution, association, or delegation.

  XYZRevision :
    is_a: Revision
    description: >-
      A revision is a derivation for which the resulting entity is a
      revised version of some original. The implication here is that
      the resulting entity contains substantial content from the
      original. Revision is a particular case of derivation.

  XYZStart:
    is_a: Start
    description: >-
      Start is when an activity is deemed to have been started by an
      entity, known as trigger. The activity did not exist before its
      start. Any usage, generation, or invalidation involving an activity
      follows the activity's start. A start may refer to a trigger entity
      that set off the activity, or to an activity, known as starter, that
      generated the trigger.

  XYZUsage:
    is_a: Usage
    description: >-
      Usage is the beginning of utilizing an entity by an activity.
      Before usage, the activity had not begun to utilize this entity
      and could not have been affected by the entity.
