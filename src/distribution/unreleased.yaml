title: Schema for a generic data distribution record
description: |
  This schema is centered on the [`Distribution`](Distribution) class for
  describing concrete data distributions, such as an individual file, an archive
  of files, or a directory of files.

  The schema builds on the elements and principles of the
  [Thing](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/things) and
  [Provenance](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/prov) schemas, and extends them
  with elements from [DCAT vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3).

  Through the joint set of included concepts and properties this schema
  supports the description of

  - data versions and composition
  - data access methods
  - data access rights and policies
  - related resources, including topics, data types/formats
  - provenance of data and related entities

  Importantly, all this information can be represented using the
  [`Distribution`](Distribution) class as a structural container. Hence this schema
  is particularly suitable for systems that (only) support attaching metadata to
  data objects.

  For more information, see the [general documentation](about.md), and concrete
  examples on the documentation pages of individual classes. Some noteworthy
  examples are

  - [data type annotation](Distribution/#example-distribution-datatypes)
  - [data format annotation](Distribution/#example-distribution-format)
  - [dataset as an outcome of a study](Resource/#example-resource-study)
  - [access to a `Distribution`](Distribution/#example-distribution-access)
  - [dataset version in the form of a Git commit](Resource/#example-resource-gitcommit)
  - [git-annex remote as a `DataService`](DataService/#example-dataservice-annexremote)

  The schema is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

      - Characteristics of a particular `Dataservice` that do not vary across `Distributions` that can be requested from the `DataService` are considered properties (`has_property`) of the `Dataservice`. In contrast, information needed in addition for requesting a particular `Distribution` are considered an access request parameter (`has_parameter`). Such parameters can be declared for a `DataService`, and provided for a particular `Distribution` via a dedicated `QualifiedAccess` relation.
