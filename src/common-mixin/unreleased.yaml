title: Collection of common properties for use in schemas
description: |
  This schema mixin provides a collection of common properties for use in other
  schemas. It can be imported directly into other linkml schemas, or any of its
  individual property definitions can be used by their URI as vocabulary
  components or definitions (e.g., `dlprops-mixin:name` identified by this
  [URI](`name`)).

  Slot names use the plural form whenever they are directly declared as
  "multivalued" in this schema, otherwise the singular form is used for
  the slot name. The `slot_uri` always uses the singular form.

  Every property declared here is mapped to standard/established vocabularies.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

  name:
    description: >-
      Name of the subject. A name is closely related to a `title`, but often
      more compact and identifier-like, but without the implication of
      uniqueness of an identifier. A name is often used by technical systems
      to display an item in an organizational structure, such as a file
      in a directory hierarchy.
