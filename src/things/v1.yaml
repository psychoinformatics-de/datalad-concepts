title: Generic schema for an arbitrarily detailed description of "things"
description: |
  STILL A DRAFT!!

  This schema provides a generic [`Thing`](Thing) concept as a basic building block.
  Key concepts of this schema are that any `Thing`
 
  - has a unique identifier ([`id`](id))
  - can be further described by attributes ([`has_attributes`](has_attributes))
    and qualified relations to other "things"
    ([`is_characterized_by`](is_characterized_by)),
    without prescribing a particular vocabulary
  - can be associated with a specialized schema class for enabling detailed
    validation and precise data transformations ([`schema_type`](schema_type))
    without limiting the general expressiveness to a fixed set of classes
    available in any given (derived) schema.

  More information on this schema is available on a [dedicated page](about).
  Each class comes with dedicated examples that exemplify its use. A good
  starting point are the [examples of the `Thing`](Thing#examples) class.

  Although this generic schema could be used directly, it is meant to be used
  as a foundational building block for more targeted schemas. Therefore, the
  schema does not define common slots like `name`, or `description`, and leaves
  this to more targeted schemas to decide if such slots are needed, and how they
  should be defined. The envisioned use and reuse of this schema is to import
  it and built targeted derivatives of `Thing` and other classes provided here.
  See the [PROV schema](/s/prov) for an example that is built on this schema.

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../v1.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../v1.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../v1.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../v1.shacl.ttl)

  Upcoming changes to this schema may be available in an [(unreleased)
  development version](../../thing/unreleased).

slots:
  has_attributes:
    slot_uri: dlthings:has_attributes
    description: >-
      Declares a relation that associates a `Thing` (or another attribute)
      with an attribute, where an attribute is an intrinsic characteristic,
      such as a quality, capability, disposition, function, or is an
      externally derived attribute determined from some descriptor
      (e.g. a quantity, position, label/identifier).
      Technically, this declaration is done via an `AttributeSpecification`
      that combines a `predicate` with a value declaration and the
      attribute-related slots of a `Thing`. Importantly, such attributes
      are declared inline, because they do not have a unique identifier.
      If an identifier is available, a `Thing` declaration (see `relation`),
      and a qualification of that relationship via a `Statement` (see
      `is_characterized_by`) should be preferred.

      declared directly using the `is_characterized_by` slot.

classes:
  ThingMixin:
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      Mix-in with the common interface of `Thing` and `AttributeSpecification`.
      This interface enables `type` specifications (`rdf:type`) for things
      and attributes. This is complemented by the `schema_type` slot
      (also `rdf:type`) that serves as a type designator for specialized
      schema classes, to enable targeted validation and data transformation.
      A thing or attribute can be further describe with statements on
      qualified relations to other things (`is_characterized_by`), or
      inline attributes (`has_attributes`).
    slots:
      - has_attributes
      - is_characterized_by
      - schema_type
      - type

  ValueSpecificationMixin:
    description: >-
      Mix-in for a (structured) value specification. Two slots are provided
      to define a (literal) value (`value`) and its type (`range`).
    slots:
      - range
      - value

  AttributeSpecification:
    mixins:
      - ThingMixin
      - ValueSpecificationMixin
    slots:
      - predicate
    slot_usage:
      predicate:
        required: true
    description: >-
      An attribute is conceptually a thing, but it requires no dedicated
      identifier (`id`). Instead, it is linked to a `Thing` via its
      `has_attributes` slot and declares a `predicate` on the nature of
      the relationship.
    exact_mappings:
      - sio:SIO_000614
    close_mappings:
      - dlthings:Thing

  Property:
    class_uri: dlthings:Property
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      An RDF property, a `Thing` used to define a `predicate`, for example
      in a `Statement`.
    exact_mappings:
      - rdf:Property

  Statement:
    class_uri: dlthings:Statement
    description: >-
      An RDF statement that links a `predicate` (a `Property`) with an
      `object` (a `Thing`) to the subject to form a triple.
      A `Statement` is used to qualify a relation to a `Thing` referenced
      by its identifier. For specifying a qualified relation to an
      attribute that has no dedicated identifier, use
      an `AttributeSpecification`.
    slots:
      - object
      - predicate
    slot_usage:
      object:
        required: true
      predicate:
        required: true
    exact_mappings:
      - rdf:Statement

  Thing:
    class_uri: dlthings:Thing
    mixins:
      - ThingMixin
    description: >-
      The most basic, identifiable item. In addition to the slots
      that are common between a `Thing` and an `AttributeSpecification`
      (see `ThingMixin`), two additional slots are provided. The `id`
      slot takes the required identifier for a `Thing`. The `relation`
      slot allows for the inline specification of other `Thing` instances.
      Such a relation is unqualified (and symmetric), and should be
      further characterized via a `Statement` (see `is_characterized_by`).
      From a schema perspective, the `relation` slots allows for building
      self-contained, structured documents (e.g., a JSON object) with
      arbitrarily complex information on a `Thing`.
    slots:
      - id
      - relations
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Thing

  ValueSpecification:
    is_a: Thing
    mixins:
      - ValueSpecificationMixin
    description: >-
      A `Thing` that is a value of some kind. This class can be used
      to describe an outcome of a measurement, a factual value or constant,
      or other qualitative or quantitative information with an associated
      identifier. If no identifier is available, an `AttributeSpecification`
      can be used within the context of an associated `Thing`
      (`has_attributes`).
    slot_usage:
      value:
        required: true
        notes:
          - >-
            It is required, because when it is not needed, `Thing` should
            be used as a type. Its absence is therefore likely a sign of
            an error.
