      social norms, or criteria, often taking the form of a custom.

  Dataset:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent. This is a
      conceptual entity. A single dataset might be available in more than
      one representation, with differing schematic layouts, formats, and
      serializations.

      - title

  Document:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A conceptual entity representing things which a, broadly conceived,
      "documents. This includes non-textual things like images.
      A conceputal document is to be distinguished from its physical,
      or electronic distributions.

      - kind
      - title

      description:
        annotations:
          sh:order: 3
    notes:
      - The key difference between a dataset and a document is the
        collection-nature of the dataset (multiple items of a kind in
        a collection), whereas a document is "one of its kind". A
        dataset could comprise multiple documents.
      - A document typically has at least one author. However, there are
        also generated documents (e.g., a birth certificate) for which this is
        irrelevant. And there are more roles that could be relevant for a
        document's provenance. Rather than adding them all, none is provided.

  Grant:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable,
      resources.
    slots:
      - howto_acknowledge
      - sponsor
      - title
      - received_by

      sponsor:
        range: Thing
        comments:
          - In a particular context, a sponsor might always be an organization,
            but in others it could be one or more individuals. Leaving it
            open here.

    exact_mappings:
      - obo:NCIT_C16644
      - schema:Grant
    notes:
      - A grant is not a document. The associated document would be the
        grant agreement.
      - Not all grants have titles, hence there is no such slot defined here.

  Instrument:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A thing that enables an agent to perform an action. This is typically a device
      (e.g., a machine to perform a particular type of measurement), but it can also be
      a questionnaire that is used to perform a particular kind of assessment.
      An instrument is typically not a "reagent".
    related_mappings:
      - schema:instrument
    narrow_mappings:
      - obo:NCIT_C62103
    notes:
      - It is unclear whether an instrument `name` would provide meaningful
        and precise information (vs a description or an identifier).
        There is `display_label`, if the need for a name is just for display
        purposes (e.g., to say something generic like 'thermometer').
      - Slot `name` is added to avoid `display_label` having to carry unique
        information.

      - name
      - kind
