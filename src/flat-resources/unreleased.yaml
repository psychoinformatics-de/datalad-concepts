  Convention:

      A set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards, norms,
      social norms, or criteria, often taking the form of a custom.

  DataItem:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      An information content entity that is intended to be a truthful statement about
      something (modulo, e.g., measurement precision or other systematic errors) and
      is constructed/acquired by a method which reliably tends to produce
      (approximately) truthful statements.

      This is a conceptual entity. A single data item might be available in more than
      one representation, with differing formats, and serializations.
    slots:

      same_as:
        title: Qualitative value
        description: >-
          The value of a qualitative assessment.
      quantitative_value:
        title: Quantitative value
        description: >-
          The value of a quantitative assessment.

      - obo:IAO_0000027
    comments:
      - The class enables the expressing quantitative and qualitative
        assessments. For a quantitative value, the numerical value,
        and a possible unit is given. For a qualitative value, `same_as`
        is used to identify the quality of the assessment from a
        controlled vocabulary or standard term. Both approaches can be
        combined, for example when classifying numerical values into
        qualitative/ordinal categories.

  Dataset:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A collection of data (data items), published or curated by a single agent.
      This is a conceptual entity. A single dataset might be available in more than
      one representation, with differing schematic layouts, formats, and serializations.

  Document:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A conceptual entity representing things which a, broadly conceived,
      "documents. This includes non-textual things like images.
      A conceputal document is to be distinguished from its physical,
      or electronic distributions.

      part_of:
        range: Document
        annotations:
          sh:order: 3
    notes:
      - The key difference between a dataset and a document is the
        collection-nature of the dataset (multiple items of a kind in
        a collection), whereas a document is "one of its kind". A
        dataset could comprise multiple documents.
      - A document typically has at least one author. However, there are
        also generated documents (e.g., a birth certificate) for which this is
        irrelevant. And there are more roles that could be relevant for a
        document's provenance. Rather than adding them all, none is provided.

      - foaf:Document

  Grant:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable,
      resources.

    notes:
      - A grant is not a document. The associated document would be the
        grant agreement.

  Instrument:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A thing that enables an agent to perform an action. This is typically a device
      (e.g., a machine to perform a particular type of measurement), but it can also be
      a questionnaire that is used to perform a particular kind of assessment.
      An instrument is typically not a "reagent".
    related_mappings:
      - schema:instrument
    narrow_mappings:
      - obo:NCIT_C62103
    notes:
      - It is unclear whether an instrument `name` would provide meaningful
        and precise information (vs a description or an identifier).
        There is `display_label`, if the need for a name is just for display
        purposes (e.g., to say something generic like 'thermometer').
      - Slot `name` is added to avoid `display_label` having to carry unique
        information.

      - name
      - kind
