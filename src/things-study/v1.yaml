title: Concept related to scientific studies for use with the things schema
description: |
  *This is an unreleased development version*

  This schema provides the foundational concepts of `Study` and `Subject`
  for capturing key aspects of a scientific investigation.

  A `Subject` a domain agnostic model that identifies the context of a `Study`
  for which it is valid. A `Study` supports classification of investigated
  `factors`, and observed outcome variable (`dimensions`).

  It is suggested to use provenance information (`things-prov`) to capture
  the relationship with investigative or data generating activities and actors.
  Consequently, no such slots are provided by this schema.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../v1.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../v1.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../v1.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../v1.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../v1.shacl.ttl)

  Study:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A planned process that consists of parts: planning, study design
      execution, documentation and which produce conclusion(s). An investigational
      endeavour that involves research, enabled by a project. The study
      relates to the scholarly and practical aspects of conducting the research
      itself, including the hypotheses being investigated, the data being
      gathered and analysed, the interpretations being drawn from the data,
      and the results obtained. In contrast, a project that enables it
      encompasses the administrative aspects of undertaking the endeavour,
      including the funding obtained, the people involved, and the management
      of the project in terms of deadlines and deliverables.

  Subject:
    is_a: Thing
    description: >-
      A subject is an entity being investigated in a study. This is a
      contextual entity. One and the same entity can be different
      subjects in two different studies.

        title: Type
        description: >-
          A classifier that identifies the nature/type of a subject.
          For specimen (a subject derived/taken from another subject),
          this classifier should be more precise than the classifier
          of the source subject.
    comments:
      - Rather than adding a `name` slot to assign a subject identifier,
        the `identifiers` slot should be used for that -- possible
        also identifying the issuing entity of that identifier via
        `creator`.
