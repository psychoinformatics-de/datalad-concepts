title: Schema for `PropertyGroup`s used in UI annotations of schemas
description: |
  This schema provides the structure of a SHACL `PropertyGroup` that can be
  specified as the value for `sh:group` in UI annotations of slots in a LinkML
  schema. The aim is to create a conceptual group of slots that belong together
  in a `sh:PropertyGroup` for the purposes of user interface representation, such
  as displaying the slots together spatially.

  For more context, see: https://datashapes.org/forms.html#property-groups

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
