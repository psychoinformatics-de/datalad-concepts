title: Data models for a research software engineering group
description: |
  This schema is using the FLAT approach (Flexbile Low-complexity
  Annotation Technique) and is geared toward metadata entry and
  submission for pooling information across consortium sites and
  partners.

  It is to be taken as a demonstrator rather than a schema
  building block.

  More information may be available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)

  XYZConcept:
    is_a: FlatThing
    title: Concept
    description: >-
      An idea or notion; a unit of thought.

      In the context of a study, this can be a tag associated with a
      categorical, independent variable in a study design, an
      investigative role (e.g., treatments), or an organizational
      nature (e.g., site labels), or a dependent or outcome variable.

      `Concept` is related to `Topic`. However a concept is more focused
      and more clearly delineated in comparison.
    comments:
      - The relationship of a focused concept with the broader concept
        can be described via `broader_mappings`.
