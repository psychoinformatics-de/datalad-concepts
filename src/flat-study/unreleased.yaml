  Factor:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A tag associated with a categorical, independent variable in a study
      design. Factors can have an investigative role (e.g., treatments), or
      have an organizational nature (e.g., site labels).
    slots:
      - name
      - factor_level_of
    comments:
      - The relationship of a factor "level" with the broader factor can be
        described via `broader_mappings`.

        comments:
          - Derived classes can specialize the range to the desired type.
