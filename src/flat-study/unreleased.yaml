  Study:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A planned process that consists of parts: planning, study design
      execution, documentation and which produce conclusion(s). An investigational
      endeavour that involves research, enabled by a project. The study
      relates to the scholarly and practical aspects of conducting the research
      itself, including the hypotheses being investigated, the data being
      gathered and analysed, the interpretations being drawn from the data,
      and the results obtained. In contrast, a project that enables it
      encompasses the administrative aspects of undertaking the endeavour,
      including the funding obtained, the people involved, and the management
      of the project in terms of deadlines and deliverables.

          A classifier that identifies the nature/type of a subject.
          For specimen (a subject derived/taken from another subject),
          this classifier should be more precise than the classifier
          of the source subject.
