  Assessment:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      The final result of a determination of the value of something.
      This is a conceptual entity. A assessment outcome might be
      available in more than one representation, with differing
      formats, and serializations.

    comments:
      - The class enables the expressing quantitative and qualitative
        assessments. For a quantitative value, the numerical value,
        and a possible unit is given. For a qualitative value, `same_as`
        is used to identify the quality of the assessment from a
        controlled vocabulary or standard term. Both approaches can be
        combined, for example when classifying numerical values into
        qualitative/ordinal categories.

  Dimension:

  Factor:
    is_a: FlatThing
    description: >-
      A tag associated with a categorical, independent variable in a study
      design. Factors can have an investigative role (e.g., treatments), or
      have an organizational nature (e.g., site labels).

      - The relationship of a factor "level" with the broader factor can be
        described via `broader_mappings`.

          A classifier that identifies the nature/type of a subject.

          this classifier should be more precise than the classifier
          of the source subject.
